This example demonstrates how the proposed technique downscales averaged sea surface temperature (SST) outputs for a sub-region of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR).

1. Data preparation

Coarse resolution GCM averages and observational data should be ready in following formats. 

(i) Structure the observational data into a matrix formatted as N × (To + 2), where 'N' denotes the number of fine-resolution observational locations within the specified region, and 'To' represents the total number of temporal observations in the current period. The initial two columns of this matrix should be allocated for longitude and latitude details, respectively.  Please refer to the "Obs_data.csv" file for an example.

(ii) Store the averaged climate model data in a matrix of dimensions M × (T + 2), where M is the number of coarse grid cells within the region, and T, which is greater than To, represents the total number of time points encompassing both the current and future downscaling periods. The matrix should include two additional columns at the beginning for longitude and latitude information, labeled "lon" and "lat" respectively. The remaining columns should be named after the respective years.  Naming the columns is crucial here as it
enables the R functions to accurately identify the model projections that are relevant to the training period.

2. Downscaling

The 'Downscaling.R' script demonstrates the downscaling process, which starts with preprocessing GCM data and then proceeds to fit the joint spatial model for SST processes.

2.1 Pre-processing GCM data

Considering that climate models frequently show systematic deviations from observed data, we apply bias correction to the GCMs averages and interpolate them to match the resolution of observational data. We accomplish this by calling the R function "Stand_downscaling()," which implements the approach described by Van Hooidonk et al. (2015).

2.2 Implementing the Spatial Model

Downscaling.R relies on a MATLAB executable to fit the spatial model and, therefore, requires the MATLAB Runtime to operate. Before running 'Downscaling.R', please ensure the following:

(i) Install MATLAB Runtime R2020b (9.9) from https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html. Note: The application was compiled with MATLAB R2020b, and using a different version may require recompiling the application.

(ii) Download and save all source files from the 'src' directory into your working directory and run the command chmod +x run BGL.sh in the terminal.
