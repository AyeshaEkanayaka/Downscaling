This example demonstrates how the proposed technique downscales averaged sea surface temperature (SST) outputs for a sub-region of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR).

Coarse resolution GCM averages and observational data should be provided in following formats. 

(i) If N is the number of fine pixel locations in the region and To is the total
time points in the current observational period, save observational data in a 
matrix of the format N × (To + 2). First two additional columns will provide lon/lat information. Refer to the "Obs data.csv" file for an example.

(ii) If M is the number of coarse grid cells in the region, T (> To) is the total
number of time points in the current and the future downscaling periods,
have the averaged climate model data saved in a matrix of the format 
M × (T + 2). First two additional columns will provide lon/lat
information. Name the fist two columns “lon”, “lat” and the subsequent
columns with respective years. Naming the columns is crucial here as it
enables the code to identify the model projections relevant to the training
period.
